`reports/figures/`: This is good. Use it for any globally relevant figures or if you want to centralize plots generated by the `training_engine.py`. Our plan saves plots directly with each model in `models_trained/<model_name>/`, which is also good for encapsulation. You can keep both or choose one. For model-specific plots, keeping them with the model is better. `reports/figures/` could be for comparative plots across models.
